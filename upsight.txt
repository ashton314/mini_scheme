Enviroments could be structured like so:

my $env = {
	   symbol1 => 'val1',
	   symbol2 => 'val2',
	   symbol3 => 'val3',
	   '..'    => {		# This MUST be a ref to the actual parent enviroment
		       symbol2 => 'val2.1',
		       symbol4 => 'val4',
		       '..'    => {}, # etc.
		      },
	  };

If a symbol's value is not found in the current enviroment, the parent
enviroment is searched for the variable.

We might be able to a bit of look up at compile time if we KNOW that
the symbol is not defined in the inner enviroment: if the outer
enviroment is dereferancable during compile time, we can do some
lookup then.
