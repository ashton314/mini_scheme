This bug is going to be NASTY. This is what I do:
* (let ((a 1))
    (map (lambda (n) (incf a n)) '(1 2 3))
    (list a (+ a 1)))

(4 5)
* (+ 1 1 2 3)

7
*

I should get the list (7 8) after running the (let) expression. Each
time map goes through something, the lambda expression has the
enviroment that it started with. It is not getting modified. I have a
bad feeling about this...

Also, trying to do something like:
(let ((a 1))
  (write a))

does not work. This should not be too hard, I think.
