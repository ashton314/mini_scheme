* Time Line

** Fri Sep 21 13:59:54 2012
   Initial commit. Project started.

** Fri Oct 26 14:38:28 2012
   Complete basic functionality. Closure tests pass. From this time
   forward, all work done is enhancements and optimizations.


* Observations

** Macro expansion
   - Macro expansion is a PIG. Fortunatly, macro expansion only
     happens once when the code is analyzed.
   - The backquote macro takes a lot of time to execute.

** Speed
   - The code seems to execute fairly rapidly. The only exception is
     during macro expansion.
